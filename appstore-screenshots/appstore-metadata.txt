DESCRIPTION (4000 characters max)
==========================================
Take control of your photo privacy with CleanPic, the completely free and open-source app that removes hidden metadata from your images before you share them.

WHY CLEANPIC?

Every photo you take contains hidden information called EXIF metadata. This can include your exact GPS location, device model, camera settings, software versions, and timestamps. When you share photos online, you're unknowingly sharing this private information with the world.

CleanPic puts you back in control. Inspect what's hidden in your photos, then remove it all with a single tap.

KEY FEATURES

• Inspect Metadata - View all hidden data embedded in your photos, organized by category (Location, Device, Camera, Date & Time, Software)

• Batch Processing - Clean multiple photos at once with intelligent progress tracking

• One-Tap Removal - Remove all metadata with a single tap, no technical knowledge required

• Smart Deletion - Option to delete original photos after cleaning, keeping only the privacy-safe versions

• Beautiful Interface - Modern, intuitive design that makes privacy protection effortless

• Completely Offline - All processing happens on your device. Your photos never leave your phone.

COMPLETELY FREE & OPEN SOURCE

CleanPic is 100% free with no ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases. Ever.

The entire source code is available on GitHub at github.com/davidbond17/cleanpic for full transparency. You can see exactly what the app does with your photos - nothing hidden, nothing suspicious.
